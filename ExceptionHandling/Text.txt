***NOEXCEPT***
1. noexcept should be used if we know the function can't thorow exception
2. a function calling lib functions can't use noexcept
3. in default all destructors are noexcept(true)
4. noexcept accepts expressions as arguments and return their noexpect bool type (noexcept(function))
5. the class which using move operation should use noexcept(true), to optimize the code with containers  to prevent copy 
   operation of objects of those class into containers, rather they will be moved onto containers
