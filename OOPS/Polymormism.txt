POLYMORPHISM:
==============
* operator and function overloding, templates follow the compile time polymorphism
* for run time polymorphism follwing implementation is done
	1. for run time polymorphism the cancrete class obj can't be used, so ptr to obj sud be used
	2.compiler implements a virtual table for a class which contains virtual key word
	3. a virtual pointer will pooint to that base class table
	4. when inherted class obj created then the virtual pointer is inhereited to point the child obj table
	5. each function in virtual table is allocated with 4bytes in 32bit computer
	6. this increase the size of class containing virtal function by 4bytes
	7. all base class function should have added the virtual destructor on them
	8. A base class object can point to any of  its child class object, but 7th rule should be followed to dlete a child class object by base class pointer
